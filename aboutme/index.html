    <h2>Levi Palmer</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone! My name is Levi Palmer and I’m from Alberta, Canada. I have three older sisters, an older brother and a 
        younger brother, making me the second youngest in the family. My hobbies include going to the gym, being outside, and 
        listening to music. I’ve always really liked R&B and country, but my girlfriend has me listening to a lot of alternative 
        these days! I currently wash windows and clean gutters for work. It's tiring sometimes, but it's nice to spend time 
        outside. I don't know exactly what career I want, but I know I want to do something with programming. I decided to pursue
        a bachelors in software development, and I've been enjoying BYUI.
    </p>
